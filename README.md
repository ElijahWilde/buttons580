# buttons580

Hello all!

My project was to create a clean, easy to use editable button interface to help nonverbal persons communicate. 

The idea is that teachers will be able to use the site to create buttons with text, color, and/or pictures and nonverbal children will be able to select buttons instead of talking. 

The interface is designed to be as minimal as possible so that both teachers and students can grasp and use the technology with minimal effort. 

Through the revision process, many of the site's non-essential features (like a site title area at the top of the page) were eliminated for the purpose of clarity. 

# Right now the site has two modes. 

In edit mode, teachers can adjust the number of buttons present and the pictures, colors, and text displayed on the buttons. 

In play mode, students can click on different buttons. 

In both modes, buttons are considered clicked when pressed or when hovered over for two seconds. 

If anyone has any suggestions for how to improve the site (especially in the areas of aesthetics and intuitive design) please let me know!

Thank you.

Elijah
