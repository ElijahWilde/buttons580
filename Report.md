# Description and Intended Audience

My project was to create a clean, easy to use editable button interface to help nonverbal persons communicate.

The intention is for teachers to be able to use this site to create buttons with text, color, and/or pictures and nonverbal children will be able to select buttons to communicate.

The interface is designed to be as simple as possible so that both teachers and students can grasp and use the technology with minimal effort.

Users toggle between “edit mode” (used for adding/editing buttons) and “play mode” (used for pressing buttons).

# Users of the site can:

-Create buttons

-Click buttons (either by clicking with the mouse or by hovering for two seconds)

-Delete buttons

-Change button background colors

-Change button sizes

-Upload pictures to act as as a button background

-Remove pictures from buttons

-Resize pictures

-Select what part of a picture is displayed on a button

-Add text to buttons

-Change text color

-Change text weight

-Change text size

-Add a backpane to the text (for busy backgrounds)

After a button is adjusted, dials/sliders/settings retain their positions so one can easily add the same settings to multiple buttons.

# Technologies/Frameworks/Libraries

Dependencies for this project are minimal. The basic languages used to create this site are JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. The site also utilizes a small amount of JQuery and a color selector add-on named “pickr.” Both JQuery and “pickr” are pulled from the web in the head of the HTML document and do not need to be stored on one’s PC/server for this code to be run. 

# How to Build and Deploy

All that is necessary to build/deploy/run this code is for index.html, script.js, and style.css to be in a shared folder, along with plus.png and Button Click On.mp3. There are no other requirements (aside from being able to run and display HTML files). 

# Problems Encountered

The biggest obstacles for me involved adding editable images to my buttons and creating a layout for my code using CSS. Before this project, I had done very little web programming. I had to teach myself almost everything from scratch. I spent hours trying to adjust margins and colors until my website looked presentable. The biggest time suck, however, was trying to put editable, draggable, zoomable background images onto my buttons. I tried tutorial after tutorial, framework after framework until at long last something worked.

I also really struggled with the sheer number of hours required to complete this project, both as a result of not having a team and only having half a semester to work. While I technically survived, I am not eager to singlehandedly take on another web programming challenge any time soon. 

# Future Work

If there is one thing I learned from receiving peer feedback it is that you can always have more features. It was my peers who suggested I add button sounds, size adjustments, and a means to more precisely adjust images. If I were to continue this project I would reach out to teachers, let them test my project, and consider adjustments they might recommend. While the product is functional, there are likely a number of tweaks that could be made in response to feedback from the target audience.
